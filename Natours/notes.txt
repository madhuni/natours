** Basics of CSS architecture **

We will use 7 in 1 pattern to architecture our CSS files. Those folders will be:

1) Base -> Will contain the styles for the base element such as body, html and all resets.

2) Abstract -> all the code which is not going to give any CSS output, we are going
to put in this folder such as variables, mixins etc.

3) Components -> It will contain the file corresponds to each component on the webpage.
Components are the reusable building blocks which can be used again and again independently.

4) Layout -> For each piece of the Global layout of the entire project. Such as
'Global Footer', 'Header' etc.

5) Pages -> If we are having a very specific styles for a specific 
page i.e. for home page, we can create a new file for that specific
page and all those pages will go in 'Pages' folder.

6) Themes -> In case we are using the web app for different Themes

7) Vendors -> Here we can put the 3rd party css files
